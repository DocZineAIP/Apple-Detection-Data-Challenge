# Apple-Detection-Data-Challenge
This project was build to invite all interested people in computer vision to solve a real life problem during automation of detection (multiscaling)


DATA CHALLENGE IN APPLE DETECTION
Multi-scale apple detection
 

Apple is an important horticultural crop and its production has a clear impact in the economy. Breeders aim to produce apple varieties with an appealing texture, taste and color. Among the traits to quantify the quality of an apple variety is the number of fruits. Classical apple counting is conducted by sampling a fixed percentage (e.g. 5 or 10%) of trees randomly or systematically and extrapolating the counts on these trees for total yield estimation of the entire orchard. This sampling and extrapolation process, in addition to being time-consuming and labor-intensive, does not always produce the desired precision of yield estimation. Recently, deep learning methods have become common place for fruit detection and counting. One major limitation of deep learning is the lack of annotated data. In addition, the unavailability of code-lines from the previous works is also limiting the application of deep learning in apple phenotyping. Those factors motivated us to organize a data challenge where research teams in digital phenotyping are welcome to test their models on our annotated dataset and the one acquired in this work [1]. Our objective is to provide to this community, a large annotated dataset and an open-access models for apple detection. One additional information that differs this challenge is the variation of apple scale inside images. As the global objective of digital phenotyping, is to mimic the manual procedure, the model should be performant to detect fruits for counting from far-distance images and detect fruits in the close-distance views for later applications such as pathogen propagation estimation.
